ascc - standalone AGS script compiler
-------------------------------------

about
-----

script compiler factored out from AGS ags3 branch[0], and equipped with a
C-compiler-like command line frontend.

the preprocessor which was long ago ripped off the original C++ code and turned
into C#-windows-only code has been restored from old git history of around 2012.
therefore it's possible that the preprocessor behaves slightly different than
the one shipping with the GUI.

current status:
`ascc` can be used to compile .asc files into binary .o files.
these in turn can be used with `agsutils` agsdisas disassembler and
agsinject utilities for updating ags' binary .crm or .dat files.
(read agsutils README for more details).

build
-----

install a C++ toolchain, then run

    make -jN

where N corresponds to the number of CPU cores in your machine.
buildtime should be roughly 10 secs with one core.

usage
-----

ascc [OPTIONS] FILE.asc
compiles FILE.asc to FILE.o

OPTIONS:
-i systemheaderdir : provide path to system headers
   this is the path containing implicitly included headers (atm only agsdefns.sh).
-E : run preprocessor only (create file with .i extension)
-W : warn about non-fatal errors parsing system headers
-g : turn on debug info
-o : explicitily specify output file name
-S : write textual assembly instead of binary (requires agsdisas)
